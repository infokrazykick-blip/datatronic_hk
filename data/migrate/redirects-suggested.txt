# Notes:
# - Current imported files use generated slugs like `en-...` (percent-encoded). We recommend reviewing and optionally normalizing slugs into human-friendly ASCII (e.g., `en-products-center` -> `products`).
# - After slug normalization, update these redirects to point to the final permalinks.
