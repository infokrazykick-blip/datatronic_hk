## PR Preview: Migration import (draft)

**Title:** Import scraped site content — migration (50 pages)

**Summary:**
Import converted content from `migrate/converted_manifest.csv` into `src/` (Pages, Products, Applications). This is a bulk import; content is an initial draft and requires manual review for SEO fields, PDFs and media.

**Files to review:**
- `migrate/sitemap-urls-full.csv` (50 URLs)
- `migrate/assets.txt` (325 asset lines)
- `migrate/converted_manifest.csv` (manifest of conversions)
- `src/pages/*`, `src/products/*`, `src/applications/*` (converted Markdown)

**Representative pages to review (please preview locally):**
1. Home — `src/pages/home.md` (check hero, sectors, featured products)
2. Catalogue — `src/products/en-catalogue.md` (check PDF link and catalogue references)
3. Example product/category — `src/pages/en-%e7%94%a2%e5%93%81%e4%b8%ad%e5%bf%83.md`

**Checks required before merge:**
- [ ] `python3 scripts/check_migration.py` passes with no ERRORS
- [ ] Front-matter fields filled for sample pages (title, date, slug, collection)
- [ ] Media & PDF handling plan documented in PR comments
- [ ] 3 sample pages visually confirmed on local Eleventy build

**Redirects & slug notes**
- See `migrate/redirects-suggested.txt` for initial redirect proposals; these should be finalized post-slug normalization.
- Many imported slugs are derived from raw URL segments and include percent-encoding; suggest approving a normalized slug list generated by `python3 scripts/suggest_slug_mappings.py`.

**Post-merge tasks**
- Media upload & link replacement (S3 / Netlify Large Media)
- Slug normalization PR with 301 redirects
- Add CI checks for front-matter completeness
